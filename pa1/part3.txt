Fused operators combine many tasks into a one kernel making it to reduce the overhead. They are useful in hifh performance computing like machine learning
and deep learning. This makes it easy to transfer the memory and helps in faster execution of tasks.Fused operations perform computations 
in parallel and store the intermediate values which will be helpful for operations that need huge memory bandwidth. For Future improvements for the 
operators can be using GPU and vectorization to make them run faster.
